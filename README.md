#Settlers of Catan Map Generator
This python program will automatically generate SoC boards that will be "fair" and "balanced".

The default game starts with the following resources:
* 4 Fields (Grain)
* 4 Pastures (Wool)
* 4 Forest (Lumber)
* 3 Hills (Bricks)
* 3 Mountains (Ore)
* 1 Desert Tile ( No production )

Numbers 2 thru 12 are repeated twice on the board with the exception of 2 and 12

The final product will use a default map with pictures and tile amounts to generate a fair board.

I used the following article to help me greatly and I would like to give them credit:
